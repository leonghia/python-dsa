DLL: Swap Nodes in Pairs (âš¡Interview Question)
You are given a doubly linked list.

Implement a method called swap_pairs within the class that swaps the values of adjacent nodes in the linked list. The method should not take any input parameters.

Note: This DoublyLinkedList does not have a tail pointer which will make the implementation easier.

Example:

1-->2-->3-->4--> should become 2-->1-->4-->3-->

Your implementation should handle edge cases such as an empty linked list or a linked list with only one node.

Note: You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only the nodes' prev and next pointers may be changed.)

*** Solution Explanation ***
def swap_pairs(self):
        dummy = Node(0)
        dummy.next = self.head
        prev = dummy
 
        while self.head and self.head.next:
            first_node = self.head
            second_node = self.head.next
 
            prev.next = second_node
            first_node.next = second_node.next
            second_node.next = first_node
 
            second_node.prev = prev
            first_node.prev = second_node
            if first_node.next:
                first_node.next.prev = first_node
 
            self.head = first_node.next
            prev = first_node
 
        self.head = dummy.next




This code defines a swap_pairs method that swaps adjacent pairs of nodes in a doubly-linked list. The method iterates through the list and swaps each adjacent pair of nodes by updating their next and prev pointers. Here's a step-by-step explanation:



Create a dummy node with value 0. This dummy node is a placeholder and is used to simplify the head pointer manipulation.

Set the next pointer of the dummy node to the current head of the list.

Create a prev variable to keep track of the previous node, initially set to the dummy node.

Start a while loop that continues as long as the current head and its next node are not None (i.e., there's a pair to swap).

a. Assign first_node to the current head and second_node to the next node in the list. These are the two nodes that will be swapped.

b. Update the next pointer of the prev node to point to the second node, effectively placing the second node before the first node in the list.

c. Update the next pointer of the first node to point to the node after the second node, maintaining the correct order after the swap.

d. Update the next pointer of the second node to point to the first node, completing the swap.

e. Update the prev pointers of the swapped nodes to maintain the doubly-linked list structure. Set the prev pointer of the second node to the previous node (before the first node), and the prev pointer of the first node to the second node.

f. If there's a node after the first node (i.e., first_node.next is not None), update its prev pointer to point back to the first node, maintaining the doubly-linked list structure.

g. Move the head pointer to the next pair by setting it to the next node of the first node (which is now the second node in the next pair).

h. Update the prev variable to the first node (which was just swapped), so it's ready for the next iteration.

After the loop, update the head of the list to the next pointer of the dummy node. Since the dummy node was used to simplify head pointer manipulation, the actual head of the list is now the next node after the dummy node.

        prev = first_node
 
    # Update the head to the new start
    self.head = dummy.next
