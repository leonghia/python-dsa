HT: Item In Common (âš¡Interview Question)
Write a function item_in_common(list1, list2) that takes two lists as input and returns True if there is at least one common item between the two lists, False otherwise.

Use a dictionary to solve the problem that creates an O(n) time complexity.

*** Solution Explanation ***
def item_in_common(list1, list2):
    my_dict = {}
    for i in list1:
        my_dict[i] = True
 
    for j in list2:
        if j in my_dict:
            return True
 
    return False
 

The function uses a dictionary, my_dict, to store the elements from the first list.

It then loops through the second list, checking if each element is in my_dict.

If an element is found in my_dict, it means that it exists in both lists, so the function returns True.

If no elements are found in common, the function returns False.





Code with inline comments:



def item_in_common(list1, list2):
    # create an empty dictionary to store list1's values
    my_dict = {}
 
    # iterate through list1 and add each value to the dictionary as a key
    for i in list1:
        my_dict[i] = True
 
    # iterate through list2 and check if each value is a key in the dictionary
    for j in list2:
        # if a value in list2 is also in the dictionary, return True
        if j in my_dict:
            return True
 
    # if no values in common are found, return False
    return False
